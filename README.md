# Budget-Calculator
Script to help you budget using the 50/30/20 rule.
This code is not meant to be super complicated or impressive, but it is meant to be fairly useful. As I get older I realize the importance of budgeting and money management. I didnt want another task on my to-do list whenever pay day rolls around, so I created this script. It provides clear values of the money I need to allocate to each category. This script is nothing out of this world, but to me, it is pretty useful. :)
